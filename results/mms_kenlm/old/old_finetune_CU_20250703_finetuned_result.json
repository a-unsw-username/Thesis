puddles","4892":"we can go after him on our bikes just mom looked out the window yes s but come back into your homework enomber you must us turn in your ideas for the science fair project tomorrow","4893":"the boys jumped on their bikes and headed up to the hill m","4894":"the boys jumped up on their bikes and","4895":"they saw puddles up ahead","4896":"his golden eals flapped up and

key thanks jeff","4899":"that makes me pedaling much easier it top of the hill the boys catch breast mike was puzzled jeff why did shifting make it easier to pedal i don't know it's just when i got something to do with sceres answered jeff","4900":"i'm just glad that we won't need a pedal so hard to get down the hill the boys looked d own the hill below they could see the rule of the coaster in the new amusement park","4901":"the park was called fun station","4902":"look at those hels","4903":"else mike","4904":"bet we would need","4905":"some big gears to climb them and strong legs sue added mike jeff looked down at the fun station fence puddles was digging on the gate oh no he groaned mom said that the fun station was off limi","4906":"o","4907":"off limits until it opens next summer the boys coasted down the hill","4908":"and then uphill pedaling pad off","4909":"jeff wondered how fast they could go and imagine how fast they could go on the relief and mike squeeze their

force that pushes","4927":"pulling exclaimed lisa on the release cars attached to the chain that wraps around gears then the engine tons the gears and the change pull the cars up the hill forest then","4928":"at the forest","4929":"the highest one","4930":"the forceill is always the hugest one when the cows reached a to the force of the gravity pulls it down the hill and then when they reach the bottom the cars are going fast enough to get up the next till by themselves yeah just nodded gravity is why we go so fast down the hill on all bikes that's right","4931":"rise report lid","4932":"your bicycle in","4933":"and the elecots are both fesgravity but there is one big difference","4934":"you'll bike case pedals","4935":"the rule cooster cars have no pedals no

machine","4940":"asked mike","4941":"sure said lisa a machine is anything that helps you do things more easily suppose that you had to climb up the hill straight and then the ground top that world coaster coasts","4942":"hill","4943":"that would be tough said jack it must easy roll coaster the climb ramp than go straight up lisa explained","4944":"my hat an idea a bike","4945":"go up the hill are they machines","4946":"lisa nodded your bike is made of several simple machines the pedals help he tone","4947":"the wheels the pedals are part of a simple machine called the wheel in the axle the hand and breaks our a simple machine called levels levels","4948":"how about the gears","4949":"he was asked mike","4950":"you're right the gears are simple machines answered lisa","4951":"then just

father but less than a week later yin yin and maggie had belt a rocket ship out a bamboo bamboo is very workable sub substance and pandas tend to handle bamboo a lot so this in itself was not astonishing at least to the yin yin to the yin yin's parents fred was sure was impressed though","7568":"sil","7569":"the main obstacle it it turns out was getting the rocket ship off the ground","7570":"maggie figured out that if her and three of her strongest magpie friends were teach gram hold of a corner of the rocket ship they could all fly tithio they tried","7571":"one two three to the moon they said together pulling with all their might","7572":"i see your wings flapping but we don't seem to be going anywhere said yin yin","7573":"hmm heavier than i thought i think we'll need more magpies said maggie but how many more said er yin yin said i'm not exactly sure replied maggie","7574":"the father watching on this through one eye for he had a for he always had at least when i asleep at all times said","7575":"this would be best to ask the owl and then closed his eye","7576":"so maggie flew off to the owl and asked for his advice oh wise owl i have a question that i fear only you can answer how she said","7577":"how to turn your head all the way around myself getting a terrible pain in your neck said the said owl","7578":"no how many magpies would be needed to fly a four hundred pound panda bear and no one hundred pound bamboo rocket ship to the moon said yeah said maggie","7579":"sil","7580":"the owl instant replied two hundred thousand and s seventy six give or take two","7581":"a week later maggie man ran up two hundred thousand and seventy eight magpie she could be very persuasive little beard when she wanted","7582":"a week later despite much flapping they were all trying to get the rock it into the air","7583":"it turns out that the owl didn't take into consideration that once you get over one thousand magpies together they tend to fight and can't agree on a single thing","7584":"now while all this was going on what do you suppose fred was doing why i was feeding the pandas like he was supposed to","7585":"so one day after fred had a feed fed the pandas and was hugging the palm tree the zoo manager came up to him and said what is going on with your pandas fred i've never seen anything like it","7586":"it's taken me a couple weeks to figure it out but i think yin yin wants to go to the moon and the magpies want to take her there","7587":"oh well that makes sense then said the manager","7588":"do you know that since the little panda built the bamboo rocket ship and those and those magpies started fluttering about that the zoo's profit have gone gone up four thousand percent","7589":"this is just a type of exposure we need those pandas will be with us for a long time","7590":"fred thought about it and said you know at i think we should rename yin yin columbus","7591":"the zoo keeper said good heavens man that's a great idea no wait a second i don't understand","7592":"well when columbus set out on a ship he was really trying to find a quicker way to get through europe in order to improve trade","7593":"yes but what does that have to do with pandas man","7594":"well it seems to me that yin yin wants to be a great explorer instead became a business woman","7595":"i see fred one more thing sir about these magpies flying above the pandas do you think that the zoo could purchase me a large size the umbrella","7596":"the zoo manager laughed and walked away but did not pur purchase a fashionable yellow umbrella for fred the next day","7597":"back in the panda's home the mother panda poo poo was very proud of her daughter","7598":"after all if it weren't for a yin yin they wouldn't have they would have had to move from their wonderful home","7599":"but later when fred walked into the panda's home under his new yellow umbrella all she could think of to say was nonsense","7600":"as for yin yin she was very proud to be renamed after a famous exploring she and maggie never stopped trying to get to him","7601":"uhm what happened and sorry was uhm there was a panda named yin yin and she uh was uhm like shee","7602":"she bacically tried to get she built like a bamboo rocket and she tried to get to the moon","7603":"and three magpies were trying to help her by flying ara there but it didn't work so they went in est","7604":"sil","7605":"the owl in the story about how many uhm magpies would take to fly and it was like two thousand and seventy eight","7606":"and but it didn't work because all the magpies uh started fighting","7607":"and but what did happen is uhm the profits for the zoo increased and so uhm the","7608":"sil","7609":"the pandas like the zoo was about to be bought out before all this happened but their profits regfour thousand percent","7610":"so then they got to stay at the zoo and so instead of becoming a great explorer uhm yin yin became a great business woman","7611":"but she got named colombus after the great exporolumbus","7612":"and it's kind of opposite of colombus because he wanted to be a great business man but instead he ended up a great explorer so","7613":"sil","7614":"t","7615":"sil","7616":"fred uhm well des fred and he was the manager er no he was the person who fred a f fed all the animals","7617":"and he didn't like feeding the tigers

about them","7619":"were if any human gets within three feet they like have to hug something","7620":"also go i'll or something","7621":"and then uhm also there's uh yin yin's parents uh poo

the young panda was not listening to fred she was talking to her best friend maggie and magpie about going to the moon","7847":"sil","7848":"yes the big one in the sky that is most likely not made of cheese and most certainly not made of bamboo","7849":"yin yin and her best friend maggie and the magpie who looked a lot like a panda would look if pandas were birds","7850":"sil","7851":"were discussing about going to the moon","7852":"her mother and father knew what they were talking about since they hadn't thought or talked of much else since yin yin said","7853":"i want to go there and pointed to the moon","7854":"enough of this nonsense said yin yin's mother poo poo","7855":"what sort of nonsense is this for a young panda bear going to the moon indeed nonsense","7856":"air job is

lady helps pay for the bamboo that you eat","7859":"such nonsense going to the moon said her mother poo poo but i just","7860":"learned how to make myself into a ball and roll two days ago i've i have becoming very good at it","7861":"i don't think it will take that long to roll there said yin yin","7862":"yin yin's father moo man","7863":"sil","7864":"didn't think it was very proper or wise for a young panda bear to go rolling off to places where there wasn't any bamboo","7865":"but he was supportive of his young daughter and showed his support by taking enough","7866":"but before he felt asleep he did manage to say","7867":"nonsense said the mother i'm so mad i'm going to look at the lady over there and make her want to squeeze her son cheeks she said spitefully","7868":"an instant later a young boy was heard saying ouch mom cut them out","7869":"i'm sorry to say but many a little boy's cheeks have been made raw when mother poo poo panda was upset","7870":"yin yin was always one to take good advice from her father and less than a week later yin yin and maggie had built a rocket ship out of bamboo","7871":"bamboo is very workable substance and pandas tend to handle bamboo a lot so this is in itself was not that astonishing","7872":"at least yin yin's parents freds sure was impressed though","7873":"the main obstacle it turns out was getting the rocket ship off the garden","7874":"maggie figured that if she had three of her strongest magpie friends were to each grab hold of the corner of the rocket ship they could all fly to the moon","7875":"sil","7876":"so they tried one two three to the moon they said together pulling and their might","7877":"sil","7878":"i see your wings flapping but we don't see seem to be going anywhere said yin yin","7879":"m heavier than i thought i think we will need some magpies said maggie","7880":"yes but how many more yin yin said i'm not exactly sure replied maggie","7881":"the father watching as all through one

magpie","7896":"she could be a very persuasive little bird when she wanted","7897":"a week later despite much flapping they were still trying to get out the rocket in the air","7898":"it turns out that the owl didn't take into consideration that once to get over one thousand magpie together they tend to fight and can't agree on one single thing","7899":"now while all this was going on what do you suppose fred was doing","7900":"why he was feeding pandas like he was supposed to do","7901":"so one day after fred had fed the pandas and was hugging the palm tree the zoo manager came up to him and said","7902":"what is going on with your pandas fred i've never seen anything like it","7903":"it's taken me a couple of weeks to figure it out but i think yin yin wants to go to the moon and the magpies want to take her there said fred","7904":"oh well that makes sense then said the manager","7905":"did you know that since the little panda built the bamboo rocket ship and those magpies started fluttering about that those profice has gone up for four thousand percent","7906":"this is just the type of exposure we needed those pandas will be with us for a long time","7907":"fred thought about it and said you know i think we should rename yin yin columbus","7908":"the zoo keeper said good heavens man that is a great idea no way jesse gain i understand","7909":"well sir","7910":"sil","7911":"when columbus set out on his ship he was really trying to find a clicker way to get to get around europe in order to improve trade","7912":"he wanted to be a business man but instead became a great explorer","7913":"yes but what does that have to do with the the pandas man said the zoo keeper manager","7914":"well it seems to me sir that yin yin wanted to be a great explorince that i've become a business woman","7915":"i see fred","7916":"one more thing sir i about those magpines flying above the pandas do you think that the zoo could purchase me a large sized umbrella","7917":"the zoo manager laughed and walked away but didn't purchase the fashionable yellow umbrella for fred the next day","7918":"sil","7919":"back in the panda's home the mother panda poo poo was very proud of her daughter","7920":"after all it weren't if it weren't for yin yin they would have had to move from their wonderful home","7921":"but later when fred walked into the panda's h home undering a his new yellow umbrella all she could think to say was nonsense","7922":"as frang she was very proud to be renamed after a famous explorer and she and maggie never stopped trying to get to the moon","7923":"i don't know it was about some panda wanted to go to the moon","7924":"on","7925":"sil","7926":"uhm it was about this like panda and named","7927":"sil","7928":"yin yin and uhm he wanted to go to the moon","7929":"and so and her mom didn't want her to but her dad just really didn't care and uhm so she filled a bamboo rocket with her friend magpie er whatever","7930":"and uhm she and pers and magpie like built it and then they didn't know how they were going to get up cause one magpie couldn't lift the rocket and the thing so th and they went to the owl","7931":"and the owl told them to uhm to get like a specific number of magpies and them like to push the rocket up","7932":"and then the owl didn't think about human like how they word all fight and stuff so they weren't getting along","7933":"and then uhm fred like the manager came up to fred one day after he was feeding the pandas in the manager said uhm what are your panda's doing and he answered like","7934":"sil","7935":"well i think","7936":"it's taken me at a week to figure it out but","7937":"\u2047br\u2047","7938":"you know i think yin yin wants to go to the moon","7939":"and a he said well let's brought us suplike four thousand percent and it's really good and so those pandas are going to stay here a long time","7940":"the red leaves were blown around in millions by the wind","7941":"and meanwhile by the further river bank came rosalind with mushrooms in her skirt","7942":"now go and answer your note let me finish this splendid story","7943":"more courage than my poor brother who stands there like a coward","7944":"he she rushes frantically across the apartment seizing her hood and ran from the cottage","7945":"they carry themselves af as if they had been drilled both men and women","7946":"lindy not being overburdened with perception did not see this","7947":"i fear that we shall have another smart gale however it won't last long","7948":"of course there's nothing very entertaining here for you","7949":"the youngster lingered for a moment or two watching myles at his work","7950":"the day ethel brown was seven years old she had a tea party","7951":"these words quite destroyed the hope of hope that of late a been glowing within her","7952":"its flavor when cooked is more exquisite far than mutton or oysters or eggs","7953":"i am in

to see you but she has been very badly frightened","7960":"he turned his back on the boy and conferred aside with lawrence","7961":"i desire it so much that i will take no refusal","7962":"and the prize cup grew clearer and nearer to her mental vision","7963":"behind lay the ship a picture not without its lighter sign","7964":"sil","7965":"the panda","7966":"why did the panda with the beautiful girl name yin yin have her name changed to the very un beautiful girl named columbus","7967":"it was fred's idea so let's begin with friend","7968":"fred fed the panda bears and the tigers and turtles","7969":"the turtles weren't so bad but as for the tigers he wasn't so sure","7970":"he didn't mind handling the raw meat he had to feed to the tigers","7971":"but his main objection was being eaten","7972":"no one could blame fred really since no one really wants to be eaten","7973":"some people did not like to bite their finger nails but fred wasn't a nail biter","7974":"so being eatinwas differently not something looked forward t to each afternoon at three o'clock when it was time to feed the tigers","7975":"for fred when it came to the pandas he had a warm spot in his

how many magpies would we n would be needed to fly four hundred a four hundred pound panda bear and a one hundred pound bamboo rocket ship to the moon said maggie","8220":"bowl instant replied two hundred two hundred thousand and seventy six give or take two","8221":"a week later maggie managed to round up two hundred thousand and seventy eight magpie","8222":"she could be very persuasive a very little persuasive bird when she wanted to","8223":"a week later despoite much flapping they were still trying to get the rocket in the air","8224":"it turns out that the owl didn't take into consideration that once you get over one thousand magpie together witendto flight and can agree on a single thing","8225":"now now all this was going on what you suppose fred was going why he was feeding the pandas like he was supposed to","8226":"said what's going on with your pandas fred i've never seen anything like it","8227":"it is shaken me a couple of weeks to figure it how but i think yin yin wants to go to the moon and the magpies want to take her there fred said fred","8228":"oh well that makes sense then","8229":"sil","8230":"said the manager do you know that since the zoo's profits have gone up four thousand percent this is just the type of exposure we needed","8231":"those pandas we sh those pandas","8232":"sil","8233":"oh oh well that makes since then the manager said did you know that since the little panda built that bamboo rocket ship and those magmies started fluttering about that the zoo's profits have gone up four thousand percent","8234":"this is just the type of exposure we needed those pandas will be with us for a long time","8235":"fred thought about and said you know i think we should rename yin yin columbus but the zoo keeper said good heavens man that is a great idea no wait i second i don't understand","8236":"well sir when columbus set out on his ship he was really trying to find a quicker way to get around europe in order to improve trade","8237":"he wanted to be a business man but instead became him a great explorer","8238":"yes but wha does that have to do with the pandas ma pandas man said the zoo manager","8239":"well it seems to me sir that yin yin wanted to be a great explorer instead of became","8240":"sil","8241":"wanted to be a great flute and instead became a business one","8242":"the zoo manager laughed and walked away but did pacurcha a fashionable yellow umbrella for fred the next day","8243":"back in the panda's home the mother panda poo poo was very proud of her daughter","8244":"after all if it wornt for yin yin they would have they would have had to move for from","8245":"sil","8246":"they are wonderful home","8247":"but later when fred walked into the panda's home under his new yellow umbrella all she could think to say was nonsense","8248":"as for yin yin she was very proud to be renamed after a famous explorer and she and maggie never stopped trying to get to the moon","8249":"uhm it was about a panda who unless the zoo didn't make enough money they would have to move","8250":"and then the littlest panda wanted to try to get to the moon and since there was a bunch of commotion and they were building a rocket more people came to the zoo when they got enough money and they could stay at the zoo","8251":"sil","8252":"this story was about a p a family of pandas","8253":"sil","8254":"and the loylest panda was named yin yin and achieand her family were at his zoo and the zookeeper's name was fred","8255":"and the zoo wasn't making enough money so if they didn't make more money then they would have to move the pandas to a different zoo","8256":"and fred didn't want that to happen cause fred was the lizakeeper and he fed the pandas","8257":"so and uh yin yin wanted to try to fly to the moon so she and her friend maggie the magpie build he rocket ship and got a bunch of other magpies","8258":"to help try to fly yin yin to the moon","8259":"and then because of that and like they dirt them building a rocket ship out of bamboo uhm bunch more people came to the zoo and they got more of money and they were able to stay at the

it the way a sheet did the sail caught the breeze","4621":"cast off the morning line aunt helen said","4622":"newt untied the rope that held the boat he could not feel the boat begin to move","4623":"i'm going to teach you to stir aunt helen said","4624":"this is the tiller you use it to s you use it to steer the boat","4625":"she pushed the til the tiller toward the left side of the boat","4626":"of the boat","4627":"the front of the boat moved to the right","4628":"when it","4629":"moved the tiller toward the right the boat turned left","4630":"aunt helen moved the sail to catch more wind","4631":"you sail by knowing the direction of the wind she said","4632":"right now the wind is coming from the ocean","4633":"how do you know net asked one d one way is to look at the flag in town dock","4634":"on the town dock","4635":"aunt helen explained","4636":"what if you're far from land and you can't see the flag","4637":"newt asked","4638":"i tie a piece of red yarn to the top of the mast","4639":"aunt helen pointed up see it","4640":"it's called a","4641":"telltale","4642":"this is the morning breeze blowing in from the ocean","4643":"in the evening the wind","4644":"blows out from the land","4645":"why doesn't the wind always go the same way","4646":"in the daytime the ocean is cooler than land","4647":"so the air above the water is cooler than the air above the land","4648":"do you know what cool air does to warm air asked aunt helen","4649":"it pushes it out of the way said net","4650":"right when cool ocean","4651":"air pushes the warm land air out of the way a breeze blows from the ocean land","4652":"to the land","4653":"in the","4654":"evening the op opposite happens because the land cools off more quickly than the ocean does","4655":"when the cooler land air pushes the warm ocean air out of the way we get a breeze from land to ocean","4656":"two hours later the boat neared the island and entered a cove newt steered the boat toward so sandy beach then aunt helen dropped","4657":"the anchor and they<unk>to shore","4658":"after newt and aunt helen ate they explored the island","4659":"they returned to the beach late in the afternoon","4660":"net","4661":"noticed that the air was still","4662":"there's no wind at all","4663":"there's no wind at all","4664":"what happened to the wind he asked it's just the afternoon afternoon","4665":"doldrums","4666":"s aunt helen said","4667":"the land in sea are just about the same temper temperature so there's no wind","4668":"but how will we get home again","4669":"newt asked don't worry","4670":"there's going to be a good wind after six o'clock aunt helen said why don't we collect some shells while we wait","4671":"at six thirty the wind picked up","4672":"aunt helen decided to get back","4673":"on the boat as they raised the sail","4674":"net watched it snap in some strong breeze","4675":"is that magic or what","4676":"net asked","4677":"it's the changing temperatures","4678":"that we talk","4679":"about the mainland","4680":"is begin to cool","4681":"it cools faster than the ocean","4682":"the cool land air pushed the warmer ocean air out of the way so now the wind is coming from land","4683":"from the land","4684":"the at said","4685":"i want to learn how to sail can we go again tomorrow aunt helen smiled will tomorrow be a good day for sailing","4686":"let's ask the sunset","4687":"what will that tell us she said","4688":"red sky in the morning sailors take warning","4689":"red sky at night sailors take delight","4690":"the red sun settled down on the western horizon the rosy","4691":"glow of clouds stretched across stretched across the sky and turned","4692":"the white sail pink","4693":"net decided that tomorrow would be a fine day for sailing on the wind","4694":"uhm there's a little boy that","4695":"uhm","4696":"goes sailing with his aunt","4697":"and he learns how to","4698":"know when a good sail when you sail really well","4699":"and when you can't","4700":"uhm","4701":"that","4702":"this","4703":"the","4704":"<unk>","4705":"it like","4706":"the sunset can tell you","4707":"if you can go sailing or not the

happy bill ran to the store how much does that jar weigh he asked mr higgins mr higgins put the jar on the scale","4713":"five pounds that's a lot of marbles bill said he ran to","4714":"to the door goodbye mr higgins i am going to aunt jane's","4715":"house i know how to win the contest hi aunt jane said bill","4716":"can i use your old","4717":"marbles i want to win the contest","4718":"at mr

marbles make five pounds have i have a jar","4721":"said aunt jane does mr higgins jar look","4722":"like one of these bill looked at aunt jane's jars","4723":"one looks bigger than mr higgins jar one looked smaller","4724":"one was smaller the third was about the same size","4725":"can i use","4726":"you can use my scale said aunt jane bill put the bigger jar on the scale","4727":"he filled the marbles","4728":"he filled it with marbles the marbles weighed six pounds then he filled the small jar","4729":"the marbles weighed three pounds","4730":"then he filled","4731":"the","4732":"the marbles weighed five pounds","4733":"then he filled the third jar the marbles weighed five pounds that was the same as mr higgins","4734":"<unk>","4735":"now i will count the marbles bill said bill counted three hundred sixty marbles he wrote that number the next day bill went to the store mr higgins","4736":"i have the number said bill good","4737":"said mister higgins let me see","4738":"he read the number on the paper bill you win how did you find the number","4739":"i filled the three w i filled","4740":"three jars with marbles and weighed them said bill","4741":"jar weighed five

tries to win the contest for mister gray because he wanted mister gray to smile and make him feel good","4751":"five pounds like at mister higgins store","4752":"and uhm then he counted the marbles and the marbles and then he gave the piece of paper to mister higgins then he gave the marbles to uhm","4753":"mister gray and then he won the contest<unk>and then he won the contest and gave the marbles to mister gray and he and then in the end they played marbles","4754":"once upon a time there was a little brown field mouse one day he was out in the grass to see what he could see","4755":"it was such a nice acorn i will take it home he said","4756":"so he put on so he put out his paw to touch it","4757":"but the little acorn rolled away from him he ran after it but it kept rolling","4758":"it came to a big oak tree with roots all over the ground","4759":"then it rolled under a big","4760":"little mr field mouse ran to the root and poked his nose at the acorn he saw a small hole in the ground","4761":"he went in","4762":"and saw some stairs going down into the earth","4763":"the acorn was rolling down so he went down too","4764":"down down down rolled","4765":"the acorn and down down down went the field mouse","4766":"he saw a tiny door at the foot of the stairs","4767":"the the shiny acorn rolled to the door and hit it","4768":"hit it with a tap the little door opened and the acorn rolled inside the field mouse went fast down the stairs","4769":"and into the door","4770":"it shut a","4771":"and he was","4772":"in a little room","4773":"in it there was a funny red man","4774":"he had a lit he had a little red cap and a little red coat and a little shoes with points","4775":"at the toes","4776":"you are in my jail he said to the field mouse why said the field mouse because you tried to take my acorn the little red man","4777":"it is my acorn i found it said the field mouse","4778":"no it is not said the little red man","4779":"i have it","4780":"you will never see it again the little field mouse looked at the room but he didn't see any acorn","4781":"he wanted to go back up the tiny stairs to his own home","4782":"but the little door was locked and the little red man","4783":"had the key","4784":"and he said to the mouse you will be mine you will take","4785":"my bed and clean my room and cook my make my bed and clean my room and cook my food","4786":"so the little brown mouse made the little red man's bed and cleaned the little red man's room","4787":"and cooked the little red man's food","4788":"at and every day the little red man went away out the tiny door and did not come back until afternoon","4789":"but he always locked the door after him and the and took the key","4790":"at last one day he was in such a

not want to go without a the pretty acorn","4793":"he did not know where it was he looked","4794":"everywhere","4795":"he looked in every little drawer","4796":"but it was not there he hooked in every closet but could not find it then he got up on a chair and opened","4797":"a teeny tiny door on the wall","4798":"there it was his","4799":"he took it in his paws then","4800":"then he took it in his mouth","4801":"then he ran away","4802":"he pushed open the little door he climbed up up up the little stairs","4803":"he came out the hole under the root","4804":"and ran and ran into the

then","4826":"he went up the stairs and he went around the field and found his home","4827":"and the little red man uhm trapped him","4828":"then he was s in such a rush that he didn't lock the door

whole handful","4840":"then he tried","4841":"to pull his hand out his mouth","4842":"the mouth","4843":"of the jar was too small for his fist","4844":"he pulled and pulled because","4845":"because","4846":"became very angry in the jar","4847":"but it was no use","4848":"his hand was stuck","4849":"at last he began to scream and cry his mother ran to the room to see what was wrong with him what's the matter","4850":"albert","4851":"she asked","4852":"this mean old jar will not let my hand","4853":"have this hand of nuts cried albert","4854":"his mother laughed and when she thought p","4855":"case of his","4856":"trouble","4857":"you greedy boy","4858":"you don't","4859":"need a whole handful at once she said","4860":"try taking","4861":"talking out a few at the time","4862":"albert","4863":"albert came to go","4864":"let go t of the nuts","4865":"and took only two","4866":"his hand came out easily when you get into","4867":"into","4868":"trouble again stop and think of a way to fix it","4869":"instead of screaming said his mother","4870":"oh and next time","4871":"don't get so greedy","4872":"albert was trying to like","4873":"take","4874":"out some nuts because he loves peanut","4875":"well he loves nuts","4876":"and","4877":"he grabbed a whole handful","4878":"so he tried to take<unk>but it won't go but then he took out t like a couple at the time and then it fit","4879":"then it came out","4880":"jeff gripped","4881":"a","4882":"with one","4883":"quick quick push on the pedal with a chain wrapped around the gear","4884":"he there he said to his","4885":"to his friend mike now try it","4886":"mike rode the bicycle down the driveway","4887":"and circled back toward jeff","4888":"gee thanks he said","4889":"it's a brand new bike jeff grinned","4890":"he liked the fixing when he just looked up in time to see his new puppy running up the hill mom he cried","4891":"i there goes puddles","4892":"we can go after him on our bikes jeff's mom looked out the window yes yes but come back and do your homework remember you must us turn in your ideas for the science fair project tomorrow","4893":"the boys jumped on their bikes and headed up to the hill","4894":"the boys jumped","4895":"they saw puddles up ahead","4896":"his golden ears flopped up and down as he ran over the hilltop","4897":"the boys pushed harder on the pedals as they climbed","4898":"the steep hill change your gears mike yelled jeff he watched as mike's chain slipped over a large gear thanks jeff","4899":"that makes me pedaling much easier at the top of the hill the boys kept<unk>breath mike was puzzled jeff why did shifting make it easier to pedal i don't know it's just when i got something to do with gears answered jeff","4900":"i'm just glad that we won't need to pedal so hard to get down the hill the boys looked d the hill below they could see the roller coaster in the new amusement park","4901":"the park was called the fun station","4902":"look at those hills","4903":"hills mike","4904":"bet we would need","4905":"some big gears to climb them and strong legs too added mike jeff looked down at the fun station fence puddles was digging under the gate oh no he groaned mom said that the fun station was off limits until","4906":"oh","4907":"off limits until it opens next summer the boys coasted down the hill","4908":"and then uphill pedaling pad off","4909":"jeff wondered how fast they could go imagine how fast they could go on the roller coaster mike and ike jeff and mike squeezed their hand t brakes to slow down they reached the fence they jeff dropped to his knees he peered through the hole","4910":"puddles was nowhere in sight puddles puddles","4911":"mike and jeff shouted but puddles did not return","4912":"then over the sounds of the workers they heard a family a familiar bark from f from the over other side of the fence a woman spoke have you lost your dog yes cried jeff do you have do you have puddles","4913":"well said the woman i don't know if it's puddles but it's a friendly cocker spaniel","4914":"that's puddles cried jeff can you make him come back through this hole the woman laughed here i bet it's easier if puddles","4915":"les if i open the gate","4916":"a few minutes","4917":"and it's puddles w was in jeff's arms jeff hugged","4918":"him puddles wiggled to get free but he was jeff wasn't about to let him escape again","4919":"jeff looked up at the woman thank you for bringing puddles out","4920":"no problem said the young woman my name's lisa i'm one of the engineers building the great gravity machine i i was playing with puddles when i heard you call","4921":"that's the great","4922":"what's the great gravity machine asked jeff that's the name for the roller coaster lisa pointed toward the big steel hills wow it's huge","4923":"said mike can see why they call it the","4924":"call it the great","4925":"but why about gravity","4926":"well gravity is a force a force that pushes","4927":"pulls things explained lisa on the roller coaster cars attach to the chain that wraps around gears then the engine turns the gears and the chains pulls the cars up the hill first them","4928":"at the first hill","4929":"the highest one","4930":"the first hill is always the highest one when the cars reach the top the force of the gravity pulls it down the hill m and then when they reach the bottom when the cars are going fast enough to get up the next hill by themselves yeah jeff nodded gravity is why we go so fast down the hill on our bikes that's right","4931":"lisa replied","4932":"your bicycle and","4933":"and the roller coaster both use gravity but there is one big difference","4934":"your bike has pedals","4935":"the roller coaster cars have no pedals no engine","4936":"the roller coaster car has several simple machines simple machines have only two or","4937":"one or two parts the simple machine is an","4938":"what's a ra","4939":"amp what's a ramp a machine","4940":"asked mike","4941":"sure said lisa a machine is anything that helps you do things more easily suppose that you had to climb up the hill straight and then the ground top that roller coaster coasts","4942":"hill","4943":"that would be tough said jack it's much easier for a roller coaster to climb a ramp than go straight up lisa explained","4944":"mike had an idea our bikes","4945":"go up the hill are they machines","4946":"lisa nodded your bike is made of several simple machines the pedals help you turn","4947":"the wheels the pedals are part of a simple machine called the wheel and the axle the hand and brakes are a simple machine called levels levels","4948":"how about the gears","4949":"ears asked mike","4950":"you're right the gears are simple machines answered lisa","4951":"then just then puddles","4952":"from on jeff caught the puppy and clipped and clipped his leash i guess puddles thinks it's time to go home","4953":"jeff laughed","4954":"jeff laughed","4955":"i guess","4956":"puddles pulled his leash","4957":"leash while the boys thanked lisa","4958":"i know you're very welcome come back this summer and i'll let you","4959":"come back this summer and","4960":"and let me know i know how you you like the roller coaster ride","4961":"as the boys turned home mark","4962":"matt mike thought about his homework i know that i'm going to do for the science fair he announced","4963":"on","4964":"jeff smiled he planned to build a roller coaster of it's collection you would call it the little little gravity machine","4965":"well what happened in the story is uh","4966":"there are two boys named jeff and","4967":"they were there were two boys named jeff but i don't know the other person's name","4968":"jeff and mike","4969":"mike and they're were wondering and they were chasing puddles","4970":"and uh then they wanted to know about","4971":"and then puddles got the","4972":"then puddles escaped","4973":"and","4974":"puddles uh","4975":"basic kind of escaped and then they","4976":"puddles then a young woman named and then lisa","4977":"a young woman named lisa","4978":"helped them uh","4979":"uh helped them get puddles back","4980":"and uh","4981":"and then they were wondering about the great gravity machine and she told","4982":"and lisa told them all about the gravity and the gravity machine","4983":"and how it works and the gears on the bikes and that's the end","4984":"lois and sam","4985":"were we repo","4986":"<unk>","4987":"for it","4988":"our for the kids science news","4989":"letter","4990":"they

she was talking to her best friend maggie the magpie about going to the moon","7553":"yes the big one in the sky that is most likely not made not made of cheese and is certainly not made of

want to run to the gift shop and buy panda bear dr dolls it's simple economics","7559":"like it or not we are spokespeople for the panda stuffed animal industry which young lady helps pay for the

rolling off places where there wasn't any bamboo but he was supportive of this h of his young daughter and showing his support by taking a nap","7564":"but before he s fell asleep he did manage to say i believe rolling is a decidedly rolling about way to go if you must go it it t'would be best to fly","7565":"nonsense said the mother i'm so mad i'm going to look at that lady over there and make her want to squeeze her son's cheeks she said spitefully","7566":"an instant later a young boy was heard saying ouch mom cut that out i'm sorry to say but many er but many a little boy's cheeks have been made raw when mother poo poo panda was up upset","7567":"yin yin was also one to take advice from father but less than a week later yin yin and maggie had built a rocket ship out of bamboo bamboo is very workable sub substance and pandas tend to handle bamboo a lot so this in itself was not astonishing at least to the yin yin er to the yin yin's parents fred was sure was impressed though","7568":"sil","7569":"the main obstacle it it turns out was getting the rocket ship off the ground","7570":"maggie figured out that if her and h three of her strongest magpie friends were to each grab hold of a corner of the rocket ship they could all fly to the moon so they tried","7571":"one two three to the moon they said together pulling with all their might","7572":"i see your wings flapping but we don't seem to be going anywhere said yin yin","7573":"hmm heavier than i thought i think we'll need more magpies said maggie but how many more said er yin yin said i'm not exactly sure replied maggie","7574":"the father watching all this through one eye for he had a for he always had at least one eye asleep at all times said","7575":"tis would be best to ask the owl and then closed h his eye","7576":"so maggie flew off to the owl and asked for h his advice oh wise owl i have a question that i fear only you can answer how she said","7577":"how to turn your head all the way around without getting a terrible pain in your neck said the said owl","7578":"no how many magpie's would be needed to fly a four hundred pound panda bear and a one hundred pound bamboo rocket ship to the moon said er yeah said maggie","7579":"sil","7580":"the owl instantly replied two hundred thousand and s seventy six give or take two","7581":"a week later maggie managed to round up two hundred thousand and seventy eight magpie she could be very persuasive little bird when she wanted","7582":"a week later despite much flapping they were all trying to get the rocket into the air","7583":"it turns out that the owl didn't take into consideration that once you get over one thousand magpies together they tend to fight and can't agree on a single thing","7584":"now while all this was going on what do you supposed fred was doing why he was feeding the pandas like he was supposed to","7585":"so one day after fred had fe feed fed the pandas and was hugging the palm tree the zoo manager came up to him and said what is going on with your pandas fred i've never seen anything like it","7586":"it's taken me a couple weeks to figure it out but i i think yi yin yin wants to go to the moon and the magpies want to take her there","7587":"oh well that makes sense then said the manager","7588":"do you know that since the little panda built the bamboo rocket ship and those and those magpie's started fluttering about that the zoo's profit have gone gone up four thousand percent","7589":"this is just the type of exposure we need those pandas will be with us for a long time","7590":"fred thought about it and said you know i think we should rename yin yin columbus","7591":"the zoo keeper said good heavens man that's a great idea no wait a second i don't understand","7592":"well when columbus set out on his ship he was really trying to find a quicker way to get to get through europe in order to improve trade","7593":"yes but what does that have to do with pandas man","7594":"well it seems to me sir that yin yin wants to be a great explorer instead became a business woman","7595":"i see fred one more thing sir about these magpies flying above the pandas do you think that the zoo could purchase me a large sized umbrella","7596":"the zoo manager laughed and walked away but did not pur purchase a fashionable yellow umbrella for fred the next day","7597":"back in the panda's home the mother panda poo poo was very proud of her daughter","7598":"after all if it weren't for yin yin they wouldn't have they would have had to move from their wonderful home","7599":"but later when fred walked into panda's home under his new yellow umbrella all she could think of to say was nonsense","7600":"as for yin yin she's very proud to be renamed after a famous explorer and she and maggie never stopped trying to get to the moon","7601":"uhm what happened in the story was uhm there was a panda named yin yin and she uh was uhm like she was","7602":"she basically tried to get she built like a bamboo rocket and she tried to get to the moon","7603":"and three magpies were trying to help her by flying her up there but it didn't work so they went and asked the uhm","7604":"sil","7605":"the owl in the story about how many uhm magpies it'd take to fly and it was like two thousand and seventy eight","7606":"and but it didn't work because all the magpies uh started fighting","7607":"and but what did happen is uhm the profits for the zoo increased and so uhm the","7608":"sil","7609":"the panda's like the zoo was about to be bought out before all this happened but their profits raised four thousand percent","7610":"so then they got to stay at the zoo and so instead of becoming a great explorer uhm yin yin became a great uh business woman","7611":"but she got named colombus after the great explorer colombus","7612":"and it's kind of the opposite of colombus because he wanted to be a great business man but instead he ended up a great explorer so","7613":"sil","7614":"<unk>br<unk>","7615":"sil","7616":"fred uhm well there's fred and he was the manager er no he was the person who fred all fed all the animals","7617":"and he didn't like feeding the tigers cause he was afraid he was going to get eaten","7618":"but when he fed uhm fed the panda's he always wanted to hug them but he wasn't allowed to because like the panda's supposedly have some magic about them","7619":"where if any human gets within three feet they like have to hug something","7620":"or else they'll go wild or something","7621":"and then uhm also there's uh yin yin's parents uh poo poo","7622":"and uhm her mother and moo man her father and when uh poo poo her uh yin yin's mother gets angry she uh","7623":"sil","7624":"she uhm","7625":"sil","7626":"oh yeah she sometimes makes uhm mother's squeeze their kids cheeks and so when she gets angry a bunch of kids get their cheeks rubbed raw","7627":"and then there's the

to the moon","7745":"the owl instantly replied two hundred thousand and seventy six give or take two","7746":"a week later maggie managed to round up two hundred thousand seventy eight magpie she could be a very persuasive little bird when she wanted","7747":"<unk>a week later they were still trying and to get the rocket into the air","7748":"it turns out that the owl didn't take into consideration that once you never once you got over one thousand magpie together they tend to flight and can't agree on a single thing","7749":"now while all this was going on what do you supposed fred was doing","7750":"why he was feeding the pandas like he was supposed to","7751":"so one day after fred had fed the pandas and was hugging the palm tree the zoo manager came up to him and said","7752":"what is going on with your pandas fred i've never seen anything like it","7753":"<unk>br<unk> it's taken me a couple of weeks to figure out what i think yin yin wants to go to the moon and what and the magpies want to take her there","7754":"oh well that makes sense then said the manager","7755":"did you know that since the little panda built the bamboo rocket ship and those magpie's started fluttering about that the zoo's profits have gone up four thousand percent","7756":"this is just the type of exposure we need<unk>those pandas will be with us for a long time","7757":"fred thought about it and said you know what i think we should n rename yin yin columbus","7758":"the zoo keeper said good heavens man that is a great idea no wait a second i don't understand","7759":"well sir when columbus set out on his ship he was really trying to find a quicker way to get to get around europe in order to improve improve trade","7760":"he wanted to be a business man instead of and but instead became a great explorer","7761":"<unk>yes but what does that have to do with the pandas man said the zoo manager","7762":"well it seems to me sir that yin yin wanted to be a great explorer and instead became a business woman","7763":"i see fred","7764":"one more thing sir about those magpies flying above the pandas do you think that the zoo could purchase me a large sized umbrella","7765":"the zoo manager laughed and walked away but did purchase a fashionable yellow umbrella for fred the next day","7766":"back in the panda's home the mother panda poo poo was very proud of her daughter","7767":"after all if it weren't for yin yin they would have to move from their wonderful home","7768":"but later when fred was walked into the panda's home under his new yellow umbrella all could she all thi she could think to say was nonsense","7769":"as for yin yin she was very proud to be renamed after a famous explorer and she and maggie never stopped trying to get to the moon","7770":"and <unk>br<unk> a zookeeper named fred who takes care of them and the youngest daughter panda wants to try to find a way to get to the moon","7771":"and so she gets her friend uhm the magpie to try to help her and","7772":"sil","7773":"uhm meanwhile fred is trying to figure out like","7774":"he's very sad cause the panda's might have to leave the zoo because there's not enough money and to keep them around <unk>br<unk> and","7775":"so uhm the magpie and the panda make a rocket out of bamboo to try to get to the moon and they gather up like a thousand or so magpies to try to fly the rocket to the moon","7776":"and","7777":"sil","7778":"it turns out that since they were building a rocket it attracted a lot of attention <unk>br<unk> and so the zoo profits went up","7779":"sil","7780":"uhm like a big percent","7781":"uhm think it was four thousand percent and","7782":"sil","7783":"so the panda's got to stay but uhm th so they didn't have to leave to a bigger zoo but they never stopped trying to get to the moon","7784":"sil","7785":"she saw that she was on the grass and the broken wheel beside her","7786":"sil","7787":"know then that if i tell you the reason i shall instantly die","7788":"aye i know said the dame gently fearing to interrupt the story","7789":"you certainly are an able minded youngster hiram he observed","7790":"after dinner jordan crept up by way of the back stairs to see her","7791":"then they journeyed onwards till they almost reached the mountains","7792":"thy sword cannot stand against an oaken staff such as mine","7793":"for you never knew exactly what this man might say or do","7794":"and still she sat and still she reeled and still she wished for company","7795":"don't make any of your abrupt remarks or do anything odd will you","7796":"he tilted his hat brim to shade his face and looked for his chickens","7797":"the poor persecuted country people believed that the new forest was enchanted","7798":"tom's costume was a splendid imitation of a cowboy","7799":"your lordship is greatly to be congratulated he said warmly","7800":"if i were as big as you are jim i'd fight these miserable turnip roots","7801":"it was that day when you got your toe pounded added davie looking at joel","7802":"nan received a sewing machine to remind her of the fresh air work","7803":"we all looked at each other trying to glean something from each other","7804":"diana shook her head gleefully her black eyes dancing with merriment","7805":"then he pulled the hood of his cloak over his ears and over his brow","7806":"which of you boys placed this stone signal asked the young explorer","7807":"they shook the flour off her and set her down on the kitchen floor","7808":"i beg your pardon said the learned man it is an old habit of with me","7809":"sil","7810":"sil","7811":"the panda","7812":"why did a panda with a beautiful girl name yin yin have her name changed to the b to the very un beautiful girl name columbus","7813":"it was fred's idea so let's begin with fred","7814":"fred fed the panda bears the tigers and the turtles","7815":"the turtles weren't so bad but as for the tigers he wasn't so sure","7816":"he didn't mind handling the raw meat he had to feed to the tigers his main objection was to being to being eaten","7817":"no one could blame fred really since no one really wants to be eaten","7818":"some people do not like to bite their finger nails but fred wasn't a nail biter so being eaten was definitely not something he looked forward to","7819":"each afternoon at three o'clock when it was time to feed the tigers","7820":"for fred when it came to the pandas he had a warm spot in his heart actually it was a eighty five point five degree spot on his left kidney","7821":"<unk>br<unk> but the point is that he was very fond of feeding the pandas","7822":"there were three pandas and they were known as the pan family","7823":"<unk>br<unk> they were in order of cuteness yin yin the young daughter poo poo and mother and moo man the gentle and always sleepy father","7824":"many people know that pandas eat bamboo a lot of it","7825":"a lot of bamboo can get quite heavy so because of the pandas fred became very strong and was","7826":"sil","7827":"in terrific shape","7828":"but physical fitness was not the only reason that fred loved the panda","7829":"the other reason was that anyone who gets within three feet of the panda automatically falls in love with them","7830":"it's a law of nature","7831":"at further distances pandas have a strange almost magical effect on human beings<unk>which makes us want to hug and squeeze things","7832":"fred was not allowed to actually hug the panda bears since that could be dangerous","7833":"so all the other people at the zoo would not know that the pandas had just been fed when they saw fred hugging the rather un cuddly palm tree outside of the panda's home","7834":"it is interesting to point out at this time that more stuffed panda bears are sold to zoo gift shops then all of the other stuffed animals combined","7835":"this can almost certainly be accounted for by this strange almost magical effect that the panda possess possess","7836":"but everything was not all bamboo and hugs at the zoo","7837":"one morning fred was feeding yin yin and said oh yin yin i wish that more people would come to visit the zoo","7838":"i know i shouldn't be telling you this but we might have to sell you and your family to the big zoo in san angeles","7839":"if we don't get more money it's not that you aren't selling enough stuffed panda bears","7840":"it's just that they haven't been enough people coming to see you in the first place","7841":"i think that the zoo needs its a great adventure campaign","7842":"fred was starting to feel the uncomfortable urge to hug the panda","7843":"so before he ran off to hug the palm tree quickly he said it costs so much to feed you panda bears i would hate it if you had to leave us","7844":"after all it's only home you know besides if you leave i'll get terribly out of shape","7845":"now if you excuse me i need to squeeze something before i scream","7846":"but yin yin the young panda was not listening to fred she was talking to her best friend maggie and magpie about going to the moon","7847":"sil","7848":"<unk>br<unk> yes the big one in the sky that is most likely not made of cheese and most certainly not made of bamboo","7849":"yin yin and her best friend maggie and the magpie<unk>who looked a lot like a panda would look if pandas were birds","7850":"sil","7851":"were discussing about going to the moon","7852":"her mother and father knew what they were talking about since they hadn't thought or talked of much else since yin yin said","7853":"i want to go there and pointed to the moon","7854":"enough of this nonsense said yin yin's mother poo poo","7855":"what sort of nonsense is this for a young panda bear going to the moon indeed nonsense","7856":"your job is to be cute so people won't to run to the gift shop and buy panda bear dolls","7857":"it's simple economics","7858":"like it or not we are spokespeople for the pandas stuffed animals industry which young lady helps pay for the bamboo that you eat","7859":"such nonsense going to the moon said her mother poo poo","7860":"but i just learned how to make myself into a ball and roll two days ago i've i have becoming very good at it","7861":"i don't think it will take that long to roll there said yin yin","7862":"yin yin's father moo man","7863":"sil","7864":"didn't think it was very proper or wise for a young panda bear to go rolling off to places where there wasn't any bamboo","7865":"but he was supportive of his young daughter and showed his support by taking a nap","7866":"but before he fell to sleep he did manage to say","7867":"nonsense said the mother i'm so mad i'm going to look at the lady over there and make her want to squeeze her son cheeks she said spitefully","7868":"an instant later a young boy was heard saying ouch mom cut that out","7869":"i'm sorry to say but many a little boy's cheeks have been made raw when mother poo poo panda was upset","7870":"yin yin was always one to take good advice from her father<unk>and less than a week later yin yin and maggie had built a rocket ship out of bamboo","7871":"bamboo is very workable substance and pandas tend to handle bamboo a lot so this is in itself was not that astonishing","7872":"at least to yin yins parents freds sure was impressed though","7873":"the main obstacle it turns out was getting the rocket ship off the ground","7874":"maggie figured that if she had three of her strongest magpie friends were to each grab hold of the corner of the rocket ship they could all fly to the moon","7875":"sil","7876":"so they tried one two three to the moon they said together pulling in their might","7877":"sil","7878":"i see your wings flapping but we don't see seem to be going anywhere said yin yin","7879":"hmm heavier than i thought i think we will need some magpies said maggie","7880":"yes but how many more yin yin said i'm not exactly sure replied maggie","7881":"the father watching this all through one eye","7882":"sil","7883":"for he was for he always had at least one eye asleep at all times","7884":"sil","7885":"said t'would be best to ask the owl","7886":"sil","7887":"then closed his eye","7888":"so maggie flew to the owl and asked for his advice","7889":"oh wise owl i have a question that i fear only you can

below","8148":"i think i'd see pearls and diamonds come out of the girl's mouth","8149":"sil","8150":"sil","8151":"the panda","8152":"why did the panda with a beautiful girl name yin yin have her name changed to the very un beautiful girl name columbus","8153":"it was fred's idea so let's begin with fred","8154":"fred fed the panda bears the tigers and turtles","8155":"the turtles weren't so bad but as for the tigers he wasn't so sure","8156":"sil","8157":"no one could blame fred really fred wasn't a nail biter so began being eaten was definitely not something he looked forward to each afternoon at three o'clock when it was time to feed the tigers","8158":"for fred when it came to the pandas he had a warm spot in his heart","8159":"actually it was eighty five point five degree spot on his left kidney but the point is that he was very fond of feeding the pandas","8160":"there were three pandas and they were known as the pan family","8161":"they were in order of cuteness yin yin the young daughter poo poo the mother moo and moo man the gentle always sleepy father","8162":"many people know that pandas eat bamboo a lot of it","8163":"a lot of bamboo can can get quite heavy so because of the pandas fred became very strong and was in terrific shape but physical fitness was not the only reason that fred loved the pandas","8164":"the other reason was that anyone who gets within three feet of a panda automatically falls in love with them","8165":"it's a law of nature at further distances pandas have strange almost magical effect on human beings which makes us want to hug and squeeze things","8166":"fred was not allowed to actually hug the panda bears since they could be dangerous so all the other people at the zoo would know that the pandas had just been fed when they saw fred hugging the rather un cuddly palm tree outside of the panda's home","8167":"it is interesting to po to point out that this time that more stuffed panda bears are sold at the zoo gift shops then all of the other stuff animals combined","8168":"this can almost certainly be accounted for by this strange almost magical effect that the pandas possess","8169":"but everything was not all bamboo and hugs at the zoo one morning fred was feeding yin yin and said oh yin yin i wish that more people would come to visit the zoo","8170":"i know i shouldn't be telling you this but we might have to sell you and your other and your family to the big zoo in san","8171":"sil","8172":"san angeles","8173":"sil","8174":"if we don't get more money","8175":"sil","8176":"it's not that you aren't selling enough stuffed panda bears it's just that there haven't been enough people coming to see you in the first place i think what the zoo needs is a great advertising campaign","8177":"fred was starting to feel uncontrollable urge to hug the panda so before he ran off to hug the palm tree","8178":"sil","8179":"to hug the palm tree quickly said it costs so much to feed you panda bears i would hate if you had to leave us a after all it's the only home you know","8180":"besides if you leave i'll get terribly out of shape now if you'll excuse me i need to squeeze something before i scream","8181":"sil","8182":"but yin yin the young panda was not listening to fred she was talking to her best friend maggie the magpie about going to the moon","8183":"yes the big one in the sky that is most likely not made of cheese and most certainly not made of bamboo","8184":"<unk>br<unk> yin yin and her best friend maggie the magpie who looked a lot like a panda if","8185":"sil","8186":"who looked a lot like a panda would look if a pan if pandas were birds were discussing about going to the moon","8187":"her mother and father knew what they were talking about since they hadn't thought or talked much of else since yin yin said i want to go there and pointed to the moon","8188":"enough of this nonsense said yin yin's mother poo poo","8189":"what sort of nonsense is this for a young panda bear going to the moon indeed","8190":"nonsense","8191":"sil","8192":"it's it's your job your job is to be cute so people want to run to the gift shop and buy panda bear dolls","8193":"it's simple economics like it or not we are spokespeople for the panda stuffed animal industry","8194":"which young lady helps pay for the bamboo that you eat","8195":"such nonsense going to the moon said her mother poo poo","8196":"sil","8197":"but i just learned how to make myself into a ball and roll two and roll two days ago and i'm becoming very good at it","8198":"i don't think it will take that long to roll there said yin yin","8199":"yin yin's father moo man didn't think it was very proper or wise for a young panda bear to go rolling off to places where there wasn't any bamboo but he was supportive of his young daughter and showed his support by make taking a nap","8200":"but before he fell asleep he did manage to say i believe rolling is a decidedly round about way to go","8201":"if you i if you must go it would be best to fly","8202":"nonsense said the mother i'm so mad i'm going to look at that lady over there and make her want to squeeze her son's son cheeks","8203":"she said spitefully an instant later the young boy was heard saying ouch mom cut that out i'm sorry to say but many a little boy's cheeks have been made raw when mother poo poo panda was upset","8204":"sil","8205":"yin yin was always one to take good advice from her father and less than a week later yin yin and maggie had built a rocket ship out of bamboo","8206":"this bamboo bamboo was a very workable substance and pandas tend to handle bamboo a lot","8207":"so then itself was not that astonishing","8208":"at least to yin yins parents fred sure was impressed though","8209":"the main obstacle it turns out was getting the rocket ship off the ground","8210":"maggie figured that if a that if she and three of her strongest magpie friends were each to grab hold of the corner of a rocket she could they could all fly to the moon so they tried","8211":"one two three to the moon they said together pulling it with all their might","8212":"i see your wings flapping but we don't seem to be going anywhere said yin yin","8213":"hmm heavier than i thought i think we will need need more magpies said maggie yes but how many more yin yin said i'm not sure exactly reply replied maggie","8214":"the father watching this all through one eye for he had always had at least one eye asleep at all times","8215":"said t'was would be best to ask the owl then closed his eye","8216":"sil","8217":"so maggie flew to the owl and asked for his advice oh wise owl i have a question that i fear only you can answer she said","8218":"how do you turn your head all the way around without getting a terrible pain in your neck said owl","8219":"no how many magpie's would we n would be needed to fly four hundred a four hundred pound panda bear and a one hundred pound bamboo rocket ship to the moon said maggie","8220":"the owl instantly replied two hundred two hundred thousand and seventy six give or take two","8221":"a week later maggie managed to round up two hundred thousand and seventy eight magpie","8222":"she could be very persuasive a very little persuasive bird when she wanted to","8223":"a week later despite much flapping they were still trying and to get the rocket in the air","8224":"it turns out that the owl didn't take into consideration that once you get over one thousand magpie together they tend to fight and can't agree on a single thing","8225":"now while all this was going on what do you supposed fred was doing why he was feeding the pandas like he was supposed to","8226":"said what's going on with your pandas fred i've never seen anything like it","8227":"it's taken me a couple of weeks to figure it out but i think yin yin wants to go to the moon and the magpies want to take her there fred said fred","8228":"oh well that makes sense then","8229":"sil","8230":"said the manager do you know that since the zoo's profits have gone up four thousand percent this is just the type of exposure he needed","8231":"those panda will sh those pandas","8232":"sil","8233":"oh oh well that makes sense then the man manager said did you know that since the little panda built that bamboo rocket ship and those magpie's started fluttering about that the zoo's profits have gone up four thousand percent","8234":"this is just the type of exposure we needed those pandas will be with us for a long time","8235":"fred thought about it and said you know i think w we should rename yin yin columbus but the zookeeper said good heavens man that is a great idea no wait a second i don't understand","8236":"well sir when columbus set out on his ship he was really trying to find a quicker way to get to get around europe in order to improve trade","8237":"he wanted to be a business man but instead became a great explorer","8238":"yes but what does that have to do with the pandas ma pandas man said the zoo manager","8239":"well it seems to me sir that yin yin wanted to be a great explorer and instead of became","8240":"sil","8241":"wanted to be a great explorer and instead became a business woman","8242":"the zoo manager laughed and walked away but did patch purchase a fashionable yellow umbrella for fred the next day","8243":"back in the panda's home the mother panda poo poo was very proud of her daughter","8244":"after all if it weren't for yin yin they would have they would have had to move for from","8245":"sil","8246":"their wonderful home","8247":"but later when fred walked into the panda's home under a his new yellow umbrella all she could think to say was nonsense","8248":"as for yin yin she was b very proud to re be renamed after a famous explorer and she and maggie never stopped trying to get to the moon","8249":"uhm it was about a panda who unless the zoo didn't make enough money they would have to move","8250":"and then the littlest panda wanted to try to get to the moon and since there was a bunch of commotion and th they were building a rocketship more people came to the zoo and they got enough money and they could stay at the zoo","8251":"sil","8252":"this story was about a p a family of panda's","8253":"sil","8254":"and the littlest panda was named yin yin and uh she and her family were at a zoo and the zookeeper's name was fred","8255":"and the zoo wasn't making enough money so if they didn't make more money then they would have to move the pandas to a different zoo","8256":"and fred didn't want that to happen cause fred was the zookeeper and he fed the pandas","8257":"so and uh yin yin wanted to try to fly to the moon so she and her friend maggie the magpie built a rocketship and got a bunch of other magpies","8258":"to help try to fly yin yin to the moon","8259":"and then because of that and like they them building a rocketship out of bamboo a bunch more people came to the zoo and they got more money and they were able to stay at the zoo","8260":"r","8261":"y","8262":"fifty","8263":"fifty five","8264":"s
