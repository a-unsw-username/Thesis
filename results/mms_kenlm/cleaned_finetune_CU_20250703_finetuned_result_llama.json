heart","7531":"actually it was a eighty five point five degree spot on his left kidney but the point is that he was very fond of feeding the pandas","7532":"there were three pandas and they were known as the pan family they were in orders of cuteness yin yin the daughter of poo poo mother and moo man the gentle and the always sleepy father","7533":"many people know that pandas eat bamboo a lot of it a lot of bamboo can get quite heavy so because of the pandas fred became very strong and it was in terrific shape","7534":"but physical fitness was not the only reason fred loved the pandas the other reason was that anyone who gets within three feet of a panda panda automatically falls in love with them","7535":"it's a law of nature as at further dis distances pandas have a strange almost magical effect on human beings which makes us want to hug and squeeze things fred was not allowed to actually hug the panda bears since that could be dangerous so all the other people in the zoo er","7536":"sil","7537":"the zoo would know that the pandas had just been fond when they saw fred hugging the rather un cuddly palm tree outside of the panda's home","7538":"it is interesting to point out that this time that more stuffed panda bears are sold at zoo gift shops and all of the other stuff animals combined","7539":"this must certainly be","7540":"sil","7541":"this almost certainly be counted for by this strange almost magical effect that pandas possess","7542":"but everything was not all bamboos and hugs at the zoo one morning fred was feeding yin yin or yin yin and said oh yin yin i wish that more people would come to visit the zoo","7543":"i knew i shouldn't be telling you this but it but we must have to sell you and your family to the big zoo in san angeles","7544":"if we don't get more money","7545":"sil","7546":"it's not that you aren't selling enough stuffed panda bears it's just that there aren't","7547":"sil","7548":"th that there haven't been enough people coming to see you in the first place i think what the zoo needs it is a great advertising campaine","7549":"fred was is starting to feel uncontrollable urge to hug the panda so before he ran off to hug the palm tree he quick quick","7550":"sil","7551":"quickly said costa so much to feed you panda bears i would hate if you had to leave us after all it's only home you know besides if you leave i'll get terribly out of shape now if you excuse me i need to some hug squeeze something before i scream","7552":"but yin yin the young panda was not listening to fred she was talking to her best friend and maggie the magpie about going to the moon","7553":"yes the big one in the sky that is most likely not not made of cheese and is certainly not made of bamboo","7554":"yin yin and her best friend maggie the magpie who are looking who looked a lot like a panda would look","7555":"sil","7556":"would look if pandas were birds were discussing about going to the moon her mother and her father knew that what they er what they were talking about since they hadn't thought or talked of much else since yin yin said i want to go there and pointed to the moon","7557":"enough of this nonsense said yin yin's mother poo poo what sort of nonsenses is for a young panda bear go to the moon indeed nonsense","7558":"your job is to be cute so people want to run to gifts up and buy panda bear dolls it's simple economics","7559":"like it or not we are spokespeople for the panda stuff animal in your stry which young lady helps pay for the bamboo that you eat such nonsense going to the moon said her mother p poo poo but","7560":"sil","7561":"but i just learned had to make myself into a ball and roll two days ago and i'm be becoming very good at it i don't think it will take that long to roll there said yin yin","7562":"sil","7563":"yin yin's father moo man didn't think it was very proper or wise for a young panda bear to go rolling off places where there wasn't any bamboo but he was supportive of this h of his young daughter and showing his support by taking a nap","7564":"but before he fell asleep he did manage to say i believe rolling is died rolling about way to go if you must go it it would be best to fly","7565":"nonsense said the mother i'm so mad i'm going to look at that lady over there and make her want to squeeze her son cheeks she said spitefully","7566":"an instant later a young birds heard saying ac mom cut that out i'm sorry to say but many er but many a little boy's sheets have been made raw when mother poo poo panda was upset","7567":"yin yin was also one to take advice from father but less than a week later yin yin and maggie had built a rocket ship out of bamboo bamboo is very workable sub substance and pandas tend to handle bamboo a lot so this in itself was not astonishing at least to the yin yin to the yin yin's parents fred which sure was impressed though","7568":"sil","7569":"the main obstacle it it turns out was getting the rocket ship off the ground","7570":"maggie figured out that if her and three of her strongest magpie friends were to each grapeold of a corner of the rocket ship they could all fly at in the mon so they tried","7571":"one two three to the moon they said together pulling with all their might","7572":"i see your wings flapping but we don't seem to be going anywhere said yin yin","7573":"hmm heavier than i thought i think we'll need more magpies said maggie but how many more said er yin yin said i'm not exactly sure replied maggie","7574":"the father watching all this through one eye for he had a for he always had at least when eye asleep at all times said","7575":"tis would be best to ask the owl and then closed his eye","7576":"so maggie flew off to the hall and asked for his advice oh wi owl i have a question that i fear only you can answer how she said","7577":"how to turn your head all the way around i sou getting terrible pain in your neck said the said owl","7578":"no how many magpies it would be needed to fly a four hundred pound panda bear and no one hundred pound bamboo rocket ship to the moon said er yeah said maggie","7579":"sil","7580":"the owl incantreplied two hundred thousand and s seventy six give or take two","7581":"a week later maggie managed rown up two hundred thousand and seventy eight magpie she could be very persuasive little beard when she wanted","7582":"a week later despite much flapping they were all trying to get the rock into the air","7583":"it turns of that the owl didn't take into consideration that one you get over one thousand magpies together they tend to fight and can't agree on a single thing","7584":"now while this words going on what do you suppose fred was doing why i was feeding the pandas like he was suppose to","7585":"so one day after fred had feed fed the pandas and was hugging the palm tree the zoo manager came up to him and said what is going on with your pandas fred i've never seen anything like it","7586":"it's taken me a couple weeks to figure it out but i think yin yin wants to go to the moon and the magpies want to take her there","7587":"oh well that makes sense then said the manager","7588":"do you know that since the little panda built the bamboo rocket ship and those and those magpies started fluttering about that the zoo's profit have gone gone up four thousand percent","7589":"this is just a type of exposure we need those pandas will be with us for a long time","7590":"fred thought about it and said you know that i think we should rename yin yin columbus","7591":"the zoo keeper said good heavens man that's a great idea no wait a second i don't understand","7592":"well when columbus set out on a ship he was really trying to find a quicker way to get through europe and order to improve trade","7593":"yes but what does that have to do with pandas man","7594":"well it seems to me that yin yin wants to be a great explorer instead became a business woman","7595":"i see fred one more thing sir about these magpies flying above the pandas do you think that the zoo could purchase me a large size the umbrella","7596":"the zoo manager laughed and walked away but did not pur purchase a fashionable yellow umbrella for fred the next day","7597":"back in the panda's home the mother panda poo poo was very proud of her daughter","7598":"after all if it weren't for yin yin they wouldn't have they would have had to move from their wonderful home","7599":"but later when fred walked into the panda's home under his new yellow umbrella all she could think of to say was nonsense","7600":"as for yin yin she was very proud to be renamed after a famous explorer and she and maggie never stopped trying to get to him","7601":"uhm what happened and story was uhm there was a panda named yin yin and she uh was uhm like cheese","7602":"she vacically tried to get she built like a bamboo rocket and she tried to get to the moon","7603":"and three magpies were trying to help her by flying arought there but it didn't work so they went and as the uhm","7604":"sil","7605":"the owl in the story about how many uhm magpies would take to fly and it was like two thousand and seventy eight","7606":"and but it didn't work because all the magpies uh started fighting","7607":"and but what did happen is uhm the profits for the zoo increased and so uhm the","7608":"sil","7609":"the pandas like the zoo was about to be bought out before all this happened but their profits raged four thousand percent","7610":"so then they got to stay at the zoo and so instead of becoming a great explorer yin yin became a great business woman","7611":"but she got named columbus after the great explorer columbus","7612":"and it's kind opposite of columbus because he wanted to be a great business man but instead he ended up a great explorer so","7613":"sil","7614":"t","7615":"sil","7616":"fred uhm weler fred and he was the manager er no he was the person who fred affed all the animals","7617":"and he didn't like feeding the tigers cause he was afraid he was good to get eaten","7618":"but when he felt uhm fed the panda's he always wanted to hug them but he wasn't allowed to because like the panda's supposiably have some magic about them","7619":"where if any human gets within three feet they like have to hug something","7620":"also go il or something","7621":"and then uhm also there's uh yin yin's parents uh poo poo","7622":"and uhm her mother and moo man her father and when uh poo poo her uh yin yin's mother gets angry she uh","7623":"sil","7624":"she uhm","7625":"sil","7626":"oh yeah she sometimes makes uh mother squeeze their kids cheeks and so when she gets angry a the bunch of kids get their cheeks ve dora","7627":"and then there's a manager and i don't know he doesn't do much in this story","7628":"the earl's next speech dashed the hope into a thousand fragments","7629":"sil","7630":"now all the

thousand percent this is just the type of exposure we needed","8231":"those pandas will sh those pandas","8232":"sil","8233":"oh oh well that makes since then the manager said did you know that since the little panda built a bamboo rocket ship and those magmies started fluttering about that the zoo's profits have gone up four thousand percent","8234":"this is just the type of exposure we needed those pandas will be with us for a long time","8235":"fred thought about and said you know i think we should rename yin yin columbus but the zoo keeper said good heavens man that is a great idea no

the zoo didn't make enough money they would have to move","8250":"and then the little lift panda wanted to try to get to the moon and since there was a bunch of commotion and there were building a

such a nice acorn i will take it home he said","4756":"so he put on so he put out his paw to touch it","4757":"but the little acorn rolled away from him he ran after it but it kept rolling","4758":"it came to a big oak tree with roots all over the ground","4759":"then it rolled under a big","4760":"little mr field mouse ran to the root and poked his nose at the acorn he saw a small hole in the ground","4761":"he went in","4762":"and saw some stairs going down into the earth","4763":"the acorn was rolling down so he went down too","4764":"down down down rolled","4765":"the acorn and down down down went the field mouse","4766":"he saw a tiny door at the foot of the stairs","4767":"the the shiny acorn rolled to the door and hit it","4768":"hit it with a tap the little door opened and the acorn rolled inside the field mouse went fast down the stairs","4769":"and into the door","4770":"it shut a","4771":"and he was","4772":"in a little room","4773":"in it there was a funny red

never see it again the little field mouse looked at the room but he didn't see any acorn","4781":"he wanted to go back up the tiny stairs to his own home","4782":"but the little door was locked and the little red man","4783":"had the key","4784":"and he said to the mouse you will be mine you will take","4785":"my bed and clean my room and cook my make my bed and clean my room and cook my

could not find it then he got up on a chair and opened","4797":"a teeny tiny door on the wall","4798":"there it was his","4799":"he took it in his paws then","4800":"then he took it in his

then","4826":"he went up the stairs and he went around the field and found his home","4827":"and the little red man uhm trapped him","4828":"then he was s in such a rush that he didn't lock the door

whole handful","4840":"then he tried","4841":"to pull his hand out his mouth","4842":"the mouth","4843":"of the jar was too small for his fist","4844":"he pulled and pulled because","4845":"because","4846":"became very angry in the jar","4847":"but it was no use","4848":"his hand was stuck","4849":"at last he began to scream and cry his mother ran to the room to see what was wrong with him what's the matter","4850":"albert","4851":"she asked","4852":"this mean old jar will not let my hand","4853":"have this hand of nuts cried albert","4854":"his mother laughed and when she thought p","4855":"case of his","4856":"trouble","4857":"you greedy boy","4858":"you don't","4859":"need a whole handful at once she said","4860":"try taking","4861":"talking out a few at the time","4862":"albert","4863":"albert came to go","4864":"let go t of the nuts","4865":"and took only two","4866":"his hand came out easily when you get into","4867":"into","4868":"trouble again stop and think of a way to fix it","4869":"instead of screaming said his mother","4870":"oh and next time","4871":"don't get so greedy","4872":"albert was trying to like","4873":"take","4874":"out some nuts because he loves peanut","4875":"well he loves nuts","4876":"and","4877":"he grabbed a whole handful","4878":"so he tried to take but it won't go but then he took out t like a couple at the time and then it fit","4879":"then it came out","4880":"jeff gripped","4881":"a","4882":"with one","4883":"quick quick push on the pedal with a chain wrapped around the gear","4884":"he there he said to his","4885":"to his friend mike now try it","4886":"mike rode the bicycle down the driveway","4887":"and circled back toward jeff","4888":"gee thanks he said","4889":"it's a brand new bike jeff grinned","4890":"he liked the fixing when he just looked up in time to see his new puppy running up the hill mom he cried","4891":"i there goes puddles","4892":"we can go after him on our bikes jeff's mom looked out the window yes yes but come back and do your homework remember you must us turn in your ideas for the science fair project tomorrow","4893":"the boys jumped on their bikes and headed up to the hill","4894":"the boys jumped","4895":"they saw puddles up ahead","4896":"his golden ears flopped up and down as he ran over the hilltop","4897":"the boys pushed harder on the pedals as they climbed","4898":"the steep hill change your gears mike yelled jeff he watched as mike's chain slipped over a large gear thanks jeff","4899":"that makes me pedaling much easier at the top of the hill the boys kept breath mike was puzzled jeff why did shifting make it easier to pedal i don't know it's just when i got something to do with gears answered jeff","4900":"i'm just glad that we won't need to pedal so hard to get down the hill the boys looked d the hill below they could see the roller coaster in the new amusement park","4901":"the park was called the fun station","4902":"look at those hills","4903":"hills mike","4904":"bet we would need","4905":"some big gears to climb them and strong legs too added mike jeff looked down at the fun station fence puddles was digging under the gate oh no he groaned mom said that the fun station was off limits until","4906":"oh","4907":"off limits until it opens next summer the boys coasted down the hill","4908":"and then uphill pedaling pad off","4909":"jeff wondered how fast they could go imagine how fast they could go on the roller coaster mike and ike jeff and mike squeezed their hand t brakes to slow down they reached the fence they jeff dropped to his knees he peered through the hole","4910":"puddles was nowhere in sight puddles puddles","4911":"mike and jeff shouted but puddles did not return","4912":"then over the sounds of the workers they heard a family a familiar bark from f from the over other side of the fence a woman spoke have you lost your dog yes cried jeff do you have do you have puddles","4913":"well said the woman i don't know if it's puddles but it's a friendly cocker spaniel","4914":"that's puddles cried jeff can you make him come back through this hole the woman laughed here i bet it's easier if puddles","4915":"les if i open the gate","4916":"a few minutes","4917":"and it's puddles w was in jeff's arms jeff hugged","4918":"him puddles wiggled to get free but he was jeff wasn't about to let him escape again","4919":"jeff looked up at the woman thank you for bringing puddles out","4920":"no problem said the young woman my name's lisa i'm one of the engineers building the great gravity machine i i was playing with puddles when i heard you call","4921":"that's the great","4922":"what's the great gravity machine asked jeff that's the name for the roller coaster lisa pointed toward the big steel hills wow it's huge","4923":"said mike can see why they call it the","4924":"call it the great","4925":"but why about gravity","4926":"well gravity is a force a force that pushes","4927":"pulls things explained lisa on the roller coaster cars attach to the chain that wraps around gears then the engine turns the gears and the chains pulls the cars up the hill first them","4928":"at the first hill","4929":"the highest one","4930":"the first hill is always the highest one when the cars reach the top the force of the gravity pulls it down the hill m and then when they reach the bottom when the cars are going fast enough to get up the next hill by themselves yeah jeff nodded gravity is why we go so fast down the hill on our bikes that's right","4931":"lisa replied","4932":"your bicycle and","4933":"and the roller coaster both use gravity but there is one big difference","4934":"your bike has pedals","4935":"the roller coaster cars have no pedals no engine","4936":"the roller coaster car has several simple machines simple machines have only two or","4937":"one or two parts the simple machine is an","4938":"what's a ra","4939":"amp what's a ramp a machine","4940":"asked mike","4941":"sure said lisa a machine is anything that helps you do things more easily suppose that you had to climb up the hill straight and then the ground top that roller coaster coasts","4942":"hill","4943":"that would be tough said jack it's much easier for a roller coaster to climb a ramp than go straight up lisa explained","4944":"mike had an idea our bikes","4945":"go up the hill are they machines","4946":"lisa nodded your bike is made of several simple machines the pedals help you turn","4947":"the wheels the pedals are part of a simple machine called the wheel and the axle the hand and brakes are a simple machine called levels levels","4948":"how about the gears","4949":"ears asked mike","4950":"you're right the gears are simple machines answered lisa","4951":"then just then puddles","4952":"from on jeff caught the puppy and clipped and clipped his leash i guess puddles thinks it's time to go home","4953":"jeff laughed","4954":"jeff laughed","4955":"i guess","4956":"puddles pulled his leash","4957":"leash while the boys thanked lisa","4958":"i know you're very welcome come back this summer and i'll let you","4959":"come back this summer and","4960":"and let me know i know how you you like the roller coaster ride","4961":"as the boys turned home mark","4962":"matt mike thought about his homework i know that i'm going to do for the science fair he announced","4963":"on","4964":"jeff smiled he planned to build a roller coaster of it's collection you would call it the little little gravity machine","4965":"well what happened in the story is uh","4966":"there are two boys named jeff and","4967":"they were there were two boys named jeff but i don't know the other person's name","4968":"jeff and mike","4969":"mike and they're were wondering and they were chasing puddles","4970":"and uh then they wanted to know about","4971":"and then puddles got the","4972":"then puddles escaped","4973":"and","4974":"puddles uh","4975":"basic kind of escaped and then they","4976":"puddles then a young woman named and then lisa","4977":"a young woman named lisa","4978":"helped them uh","4979":"uh helped them get puddles back","4980":"and uh","4981":"and then they were wondering about the great gravity machine and she told","4982":"and lisa told them all about the gravity and the gravity machine","4983":"and how it works and the gears on the bikes and that's the end","4984":"lois and sam","4985":"were we repo","4986":" ","4987":"for it","4988":"our for the kids science news","4989":"letter","4990":"they

i believe rolling is a decidedly rolling about way to go if you must go it it t'would be best to fly","7565":"nonsense said the mother i'm so mad i'm going to look at that lady over there and make her want to squeeze her son's cheeks she said spitefully","7566":"an instant later a young boy was heard saying ouch mom cut that out i'm sorry to say but many er but many a little boy's cheeks have been

very workable sub substance and pandas tend to handle bamboo a lot so this in itself was not astonishing at least to the yin yin er to the yin yin's parents fred was sure was impressed though","7568":"sil","7569":"the main obstacle it it turns out was getting the rocket ship off the ground","7570":"maggie figured out that if her and h three of her strongest magpie friends were to

replied maggie","7574":"the father watching all this through one eye for he had a for he always had at least one eye asleep at all times said","7575":"tis would be best to ask the owl and then closed

thousand and seventy eight magpie she could be very persuasive little bird when she wanted","7582":"a week later despite much flapping they were all trying to get the rocket into the air","7583":"it turns out that the owl didn't take into consideration that once you get over one thousand magpies together they tend to fight and can't agree on a single thing","7584":"now while all this was going on what do you supposed fred was doing why he was feeding the pandas like he was supposed to","7585":"so one day after fred had fe feed fed the pandas and was hugging the palm tree the zoo manager came up to him and said what is going on with your pandas fred i've never seen anything like it","7586":"it's taken me a couple weeks to figure it out but i i think yi yin yin wants to go to the moon and the magpies want to take her there","7587":"oh well that makes sense then said the manager","7588":"do you know that since the little panda built the bamboo rocket ship and those and those magpie's started fluttering about that the zoo's profit have gone gone up four thousand percent","7589":"this is just the type of exposure we need those pandas will be with us for a long time","7590":"fred thought about it and said you know i think we should rename yin yin columbus","7591":"the zoo keeper said good heavens man that's a great idea no wait a second i don't understand","7592":"well when columbus set out on his ship he was really trying to find a quicker way to get to get through europe in order to improve trade","7593":"yes but what does that have to do with pandas man","7594":"well it seems to me sir that yin yin wants to be a great explorer instead became a business woman","7595":"i see fred one more thing sir about these magpies flying above the pandas do you think that the zoo could purchase me a large sized umbrella","7596":"the zoo manager laughed and walked away but did not pur purchase a fashionable yellow umbrella for fred the next day","7597":"back in the panda's home the mother panda poo poo was very proud of her daughter","7598":"after all if it weren't for yin yin they wouldn't have they would have had to move from their wonderful home","7599":"but later when fred walked into panda's home under his new yellow umbrella all she could think of to say was nonsense","7600":"as for yin yin she's very proud to be renamed after a famous explorer and she and maggie never stopped trying to get to the moon","7601":"uhm what happened in the story was uhm there was a panda named yin yin and she uh was uhm like she was","7602":"she basically tried to get she built like a bamboo rocket and she tried to get to the moon","7603":"and three magpies were trying to help her by flying her up there but it didn't work so they went and asked the uhm","7604":"sil","7605":"the owl in the story about how many uhm magpies it'd take to fly and it was like two thousand and seventy eight","7606":"and but it didn't work because all the magpies uh started fighting","7607":"and but what did happen is uhm the profits for the zoo increased and so uhm the","7608":"sil","7609":"the panda's like the zoo was about to be bought out before all this happened but their profits raised four thousand percent","7610":"so then they got to stay at the zoo and so instead of becoming a great explorer uhm yin yin became a great uh business woman","7611":"but she got named colombus after the great explorer colombus","7612":"and it's kind of the opposite of colombus because he wanted to be a great business man but instead he ended up a great explorer so","7613":"sil","7614":" br ","7615":"sil","7616":"fred uhm well there's fred and he was the manager er no he was the person who fred all fed all the animals","7617":"and he didn't like feeding the tigers cause he was afraid he was going to get eaten","7618":"but when he fed uhm fed the panda's he always wanted to hug them but he wasn't allowed to because like the panda's supposedly have some magic about them","7619":"where if any human gets within three feet they like have to hug something","7620":"or else they'll go wild or something","7621":"and then uhm also there's uh yin yin's parents uh poo poo","7622":"and uhm her mother and moo man her father and when uh poo poo her uh yin yin's mother gets angry she uh","7623":"sil","7624":"she uhm","7625":"sil","7626":"oh yeah she sometimes makes uhm mother's squeeze their kids cheeks and so when she gets angry a bunch of kids get their cheeks rubbed raw","7627":"and then there's the

afternoon at three o'clock when it was time to feed the tigers","7820":"for fred when it came to the pandas he had a warm spot in his heart actually it was a eighty five point five degree spot on his left kidney","7821":" br  but the point is that he was very fond of feeding the pandas","7822":"there were three pandas and they were known as the pan family","7823":" br  they were in order of cuteness yin yin the young daughter poo poo and mother and moo man the gentle and always sleepy father","7824":"many people know that pandas eat bamboo a lot of it","7825":"a lot of bamboo can get quite heavy so because of the pandas fred became very strong and was","7826":"sil","7827":"in terrific shape","7828":"but physical fitness was not the only reason that fred loved the panda","7829":"the other reason was that anyone who gets within three feet of the panda automatically falls in love with them","7830":"it's a law of nature","7831":"at further distances pandas have a strange almost magical effect on human beings which makes us want to hug and squeeze things","7832":"fred was not allowed to actually hug the panda bears since that could be dangerous","7833":"so all the other people at the zoo would not know that the pandas had just been fed when they saw fred hugging the rather un cuddly palm tree outside of the panda's home","7834":"it is interesting to point out at this time that more stuffed panda bears are sold to zoo gift shops then all of the other stuffed animals combined","7835":"this can almost certainly be accounted for by this strange almost magical effect that the panda possess possess","7836":"but everything was not all bamboo and hugs at the zoo","7837":"one morning fred was feeding yin yin and said oh yin yin i wish that more people would come to visit the zoo","7838":"i know i shouldn't be telling you this but we might have to sell you and your family to the big zoo in san angeles","7839":"if we don't get more money it's not that you aren't selling enough stuffed panda bears","7840":"it's just that they haven't been enough people coming to see you in the first place","7841":"i think that the zoo needs its a great adventure campaign","7842":"fred was starting to feel the uncomfortable urge to hug the panda","7843":"so before he ran off to hug the palm tree quickly he said it costs so much to feed you panda bears i would hate it if you had to leave us","7844":"after all it's only home you know besides if you leave i'll get terribly out of shape","7845":"now if you excuse me i need to squeeze something before i scream","7846":"but yin yin the young panda was not listening to fred she was talking to her best friend maggie and magpie about going to the moon","7847":"sil","7848":" br  yes the big one in the sky that is most likely not made of cheese and most certainly not made of bamboo","7849":"yin yin and her best friend maggie and the magpie who looked a lot like a panda would look if pandas were birds","7850":"sil","7851":"were discussing about going to the moon","7852":"her mother and father knew what they were talking about since they hadn't thought or talked of much else since yin yin said","7853":"i want to go there and pointed to the moon","7854":"enough of this nonsense said yin yin's mother poo poo","7855":"what sort of nonsense is this for a young panda bear going to the moon indeed nonsense","7856":"your job is to be cute so people won't to run to the gift shop and buy panda bear dolls","7857":"it's simple economics","7858":"like it or not we are spokespeople for the pandas stuffed animals industry which young lady helps pay for the bamboo that you eat","7859":"such nonsense going to the moon said her mother poo poo","7860":"but i just learned how to make myself into a ball and roll two days ago i've i have becoming very good at it","7861":"i don't think it will take that long to roll there said yin yin","7862":"yin yin's father moo man","7863":"sil","7864":"didn't think it was very proper or wise for a young panda bear to go rolling off to places where there wasn't any bamboo","7865":"but he was supportive of his young daughter and showed his support by taking a nap","7866":"but before he fell to sleep he did manage to say","7867":"nonsense said the mother i'm so mad i'm going to look at the lady over there and make her want to squeeze her son cheeks she said spitefully","7868":"an instant later a young boy was heard saying ouch mom cut that out","7869":"i'm sorry to say but many a little boy's cheeks have been made raw when mother poo poo panda was upset","7870":"yin yin was always one to take good advice from her father and less than a week later yin yin and maggie had built a rocket ship out of bamboo","7871":"bamboo is very workable substance and pandas tend to handle bamboo a lot so this is in itself was not that astonishing","7872":"at least to yin yins parents freds sure was impressed though","7873":"the main obstacle it turns out was getting the rocket ship off the ground","7874":"maggie figured that if she had three of her strongest magpie friends were to each grab hold of the corner of the rocket ship they could all fly to the moon","7875":"sil","7876":"so they tried one two three to the moon they said together pulling in their might","7877":"sil","7878":"i see your wings flapping but we don't see seem to be going anywhere said yin yin","7879":"hmm heavier than i thought i think we will need some magpies said maggie","7880":"yes but how many more yin yin said i'm not exactly sure replied maggie","7881":"the father watching this all through one eye","7882":"sil","7883":"for he was for he always had at least one eye asleep at all times","7884":"sil","7885":"said t'would be best to ask the owl","7886":"sil","7887":"then closed his eye","7888":"so maggie flew to the owl and asked for his advice","7889":"oh wise owl i have a question that i fear only you can answer she said","7890":"how to turn your head all the way around without getting a terrible pain in your neck said owl","7891":"sil","7892":"no how many magpies would be needed to fly a four hundred pound panda bear and a one hundred pound bamboo rocket ship to the moon said maggie","7893":"the owl instantly instantly replied two hundred thousand and seventy six give or take two","7894":"sil","7895":"a week later maggie managed to round up two hundred thousand and seventy eight magpie","7896":" br  she could be a very persuasive little bird when she wanted","7897":"a week later despite much flapping they were still trying and to get out the rocket in the air","7898":"it turns out that the owl didn't take into consideration that once you get over one thousand magpie together they tend to fight and can't agree on one single thing","7899":" br  now while all this was going on what do you supposed fred was doing","7900":"why he was feeding pandas like he was supposed to do","7901":"so one day after fred had fed the pandas and was hugging the palm tree the zoo manager came up to him and said","7902":"what is going on with your pandas fred i've never seen anything like it","7903":"it's taken me a couple of weeks to figure it out but i think yin yin wants to go to the moon and the magpies want to take her there said fred","7904":"oh well that makes sense then said the manager","7905":"did you know that since the little panda built that bamboo rocket ship and those magpies started fluttering about that the zoo's profits has gone up f four thousand percent","7906":"this is just the type of exposure we needed those pandas will be with us for a long time","7907":"fred thought about it and said you know i think we should rename yin yin columbus","7908":"the zoo keeper said good heavens man that is a great idea no wait a second i understand","7909":"well sir","7910":"sil","7911":"when columbus set out on his ship he was really trying to find a quicker way to get to get around europe in order to improve trade","7912":"he wanted to be a business man but instead became a great explorer","7913":"yes but what does that have to do with the the pandas man said the zoo keeper manager","7914":"well it seems to me sir that yin yin wanted to be a great explorer but had become a business woman","7915":"i see fred","7916":"one more thing sir about those magpies flying above the pandas do you think that the zoo could purchase me a large sized umbrella","7917":"the zoo manager laughed and walked away but didn't purchase a fashionable yellow umbrella for fred the next day","7918":"sil","7919":"back in the panda's home the mother panda poo poo was very proud of her daughter","7920":"after all it weren't if it weren't for yin yin they would have had to move from their wonderful home","7921":"but later when fred walked into the panda's h home under a a his new yellow umbrella all she could think to say was nonsense","7922":"as for yin she was very proud to be renamed after a famous explorer and she and maggie never stopped trying to get to the moon","7923":"i don't know it was about some panda who wanted to go to the moon","7924":" ","7925":"sil","7926":"uhm it was about this like panda named","7927":"sil","7928":"uh yin yin and uhm she wanted to go to the moon","7929":"and so and her mom didn't want her to but her dad just really didn't care and uhm so she built a bamboo rocket with her friend magpie er whatever","7930":"and uh she and that pers and magpie like built it and then they didn't know how they were going to go get up cause one magpie couldn't lift the rocket and the thing so th and they went to the owl","7931":"and the owl told them to uhm to get like a specific number of magpies and uhm like to push the rocket up","7932":"and then the owl didn't think about how many like how they would all fight and stuff so they weren't getting along","7933":"and then uhm fred like the manager came up to fred one day after he was feeding the pandas and the manager said uhm what are your panda's doing and he answered like","7934":"sil","7935":"well i think","7936":"it's taken me a week to figure it out but","7937":"sil","7938":"you know i think yin yin wants to go to the moon","7939":"and then he said well it's brought us up like four thousand percent and it's really good and so those pandas are going to stay here a long time","7940":"the red leaves were blown around in millions by the wind","7941":"and meanwhile by the further river bank came rosalind with mushrooms in her skirt","7942":"now go and answer your note let me finish this splendid story","7943":"more courage than my poor brother who stands there like a coward","7944":"he she rushes frantically across the apartment seizing her hood and ran from the cottage","7945":" br  they carried themselves as if as if they had been drilled both men and women","7946":"lindy not being overburdened with perception did not see this","7947":"i fear that we shall have another smart gale however it won't last long","7948":"of course there's nothing very entertaining here for you","7949":"the youngster lingered for a moment or two watching myles at his work","7950":"the day ethel brown was seven years old she had a tea party","7951":"these words quite destroyed the hope of hope that of late had been glowing within her","7952":"its flavor when cooked is more exquisite far than mutton or oysters or eggs","7953":"i am in earnest huck just as earnest as as ever i was in my life","7954":"humor and pathos make it alive you have found your style at last","7955":"sil","7956":"seagrave knelt by his side took his hand and burst into tears","7957":"nan said it wouldn't grow in our garden but i brought some home to try","7958":"his boots creaked too so loudly but still he was not at all afraid","7959":"she will be glad to see you but she has been very badly frightened","7960":"he turned his back on the boy and conferred aside with lawrence","7961":"i desire it so much that i will take no refusal","7962":"and the prize cup grew clearer and nearer to her mental vision","7963":"behind lay the ship a picture not without its lighter side","7964":"sil","7965":"the panda","7966":"why did the panda with the beautiful girl name yin yin have her name changed to the very un beautiful girl named columbus","7967":"it was fred's idea so let's begin with fred","7968":"fred fed the panda bears and the tigers and turtles","7969":"the turtles weren't so bad but as for the tigers he wasn't so sure","7970":"he didn't mind handling the raw meat he had to feed to the tigers","7971":"but his main objection was being eaten","7972":"no one could blame fred really since no one really wants to be

we are spokespeople for the panda stuffed animal industry","8194":"which young lady helps pay for the bamboo that you eat","8195":"such nonsense going to the moon said her mother poo poo","8196":"sil","8197":"but i just learned how to make myself into a ball and roll two and roll two days ago and i'm becoming very good at it","8198":"i don't think it will take that long to roll there said yin yin","8199":"yin yin's father moo man didn't think it was very proper or wise for a young panda bear to go rolling off to places where there wasn't any bamboo but he was supportive of his young daughter and showed his support by make taking a nap","8200":"but before he fell asleep he did manage to say i believe rolling is a decidedly round about way to go","8201":"if you i if you must go it would be best to fly","8202":"nonsense said the mother i'm so mad i'm going to look at that lady over there and make her want to squeeze her son's son cheeks","8203":"she said spitefully an instant later the young boy was heard saying ouch mom cut that out i'm sorry to say but many a little boy's cheeks have been made raw when mother poo poo panda was upset","8204":"sil","8205":"yin yin was always one to take good advice from her father and less than a week later yin yin and maggie had built a rocket ship out of bamboo","8206":"this bamboo bamboo was a very workable substance and pandas tend to handle bamboo a lot","8207":"so then itself was not that astonishing","8208":"at least to yin yins parents fred sure was impressed though","8209":"the main obstacle it turns out was getting the rocket ship off the ground","8210":"maggie figured that if a that if she and three of her strongest magpie friends were each to grab hold of the corner of a rocket she could they could all fly to the moon so they tried","8211":"one two three to the moon they said together pulling it with all their might","8212":"i see your wings flapping but we don't seem to be going anywhere said yin yin","8213":"hmm heavier than i thought i think we will need need more magpies said maggie yes but how many more yin yin said i'm not sure exactly reply replied maggie","8214":"the father watching this all through one eye for he had always had at least one eye asleep at all times","8215":"said t'was would be best to ask the owl then closed his eye","8216":"sil","8217":"so maggie flew to the owl and asked for his advice oh wise owl i have a question that i fear only you can answer she said","8218":"how do you turn your head all the way around without getting a terrible pain in your neck said owl","8219":"no how many magpie's would we n would be needed to fly four hundred a four hundred pound panda bear and a one hundred pound bamboo rocket ship to the moon said maggie","8220":"the owl instantly replied two hundred two hundred thousand and seventy six give or take two","8221":"a week later maggie managed to round up two hundred thousand and seventy eight magpie","8222":"she could be very persuasive a very little persuasive bird when she wanted to","8223":"a week later despite much flapping they were still trying and to get the rocket in the air","8224":"it turns out that the owl didn't take into consideration that once you get over one thousand magpie together they tend to fight and can't agree on a single thing","8225":"now while all this was going on what do you supposed fred was doing why he was feeding the pandas like he was supposed to","8226":"said what's going on with your pandas fred i've never seen anything like it","8227":"it's taken me a couple of weeks to figure it out but i think yin yin wants to go to the moon and the magpies want to take her there fred said fred","8228":"oh well that makes sense then","8229":"sil","8230":"said the manager do you know that since the zoo's profits have gone up four thousand percent this is just the type of exposure he needed","8231":"those panda will sh those pandas","8232":"sil","8233":"oh oh well that makes sense then the man manager said did you know that since the little panda built that bamboo rocket ship and those magpie's started fluttering about that the zoo's profits have gone up four thousand percent","8234":"this is just the type of exposure we needed those pandas will be with us for a long time","8235":"fred thought about it and said you know i think w we should rename yin yin columbus but the zookeeper said good heavens man that is a great idea no wait a second i don't understand","8236":"well sir when columbus set out on his ship he was really trying to find a quicker way to get to get around europe in order to improve trade","8237":"he wanted to be a business man but instead became a great explorer","8238":"yes but what does that have to do with the pandas ma pandas man said the zoo manager","8239":"well it seems to me sir that yin yin wanted to be a great explorer and instead of became","8240":"sil","8241":"wanted to be a great explorer and instead became a business woman","8242":"the zoo manager laughed and walked away but did patch purchase a fashionable yellow umbrella for fred the next day","8243":"back in the panda's home the mother panda poo poo was very proud of her daughter","8244":"after all if it weren't for yin yin they would have they would have had to move for from","8245":"sil","8246":"their wonderful home","8247":"but later when fred walked into the panda's home under a his new yellow umbrella all she could think to say was nonsense","8248":"as for yin yin she was b very proud to re be renamed after a famous explorer and she and maggie never stopped trying to get to the moon","8249":"uhm it was about a panda who unless the zoo didn't make enough money they would have to move","8250":"and then the littlest panda wanted to try to get to the moon and since there was a bunch of commotion and th they were building a rocketship more people came to the zoo and they got enough money and they could stay at the zoo","8251":"sil","8252":"this story was about a p a family of panda's","8253":"sil","8254":"and the littlest panda was named yin yin and uh she and her family were at a zoo and the zookeeper's name was fred","8255":"and the zoo wasn't making enough money so if they didn't make more money then they would have to move the pandas to a different zoo","8256":"and fred didn't want that to happen cause fred was the zookeeper and he fed the pandas","8257":"so and uh yin yin wanted to try to fly to the moon so she and her friend maggie the magpie built a rocketship and got a bunch of other magpies","8258":"to help try to fly yin yin to the moon","8259":"and then because of that and like they them building a rocketship out of bamboo a bunch more people came to the zoo and they got more
